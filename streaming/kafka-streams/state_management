Recovery Flow

Task = [Input partition topic] + [Stream Topology]
Task has
- Local state
- Topology
- Consumer Thread
- Producer Thread

Events come from Kafka topics
Tasks process events and update RocksDB
Updates are also written to changelog topics
Offsets are checkpointed locally
On failure:
		Another instance picks up the task
		Replays changelog to restore state
		Resumes from last checkpointed offset
