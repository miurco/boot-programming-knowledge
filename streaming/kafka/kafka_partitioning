Kafka is a distributed system.


If a topic were constrained to live on one machine in a cluster it would place a prety radical limit on ability of kafka to scale.
A topic never get bigger than the biggest node you can deploy.





Partitioning single topic log and breaks it into multiple logs each of which can leave off on separate node on Kafka cluster


 partition   0
 
 partition   1

 partition   2




How kafka achieve deliver-once semantics
------------------

ensures that each message sent to a kafka topic is delivered to the consumer exactly once.This is crucial
in distributed system where data consistency and integrity are vital.


1. Idempotent Producer
  Producer are configured to be idempotent, meaning they can send message multiple times but it will be commited only once.
2. Transactional Messaging
	Kafka supports transactions, allowing producers to send a batch of messages to multiple partitions atomically.
	This ensures that either all messages are commited successfully, or none are.

  props.put("transactional.id", "unique-transactional-id"); //Required for transactional messaging
	props.put("enable.idempotence", "true");
	props.put("acks", "all");

How to ensure order of messaging in kafka
----------------------

Kafka guaranties that the order of messages is preserved within a single partition. However, kafka does not
provide ordering guarantees across different partitions of the same topic.


Partitioning Strategy:
	- To maintain order for a specific subset of messages, use key-based partitioning strategy. Messages with the same key will go to 
	  the same partition, preserving their order.

Single Partition, this limits scalability

Ensure each partition is consumed by only one consumer thread within the group
