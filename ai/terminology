Machine Learning, a field of study in AI concerned with study and development of statistical algorithms.
This algorithms are used to learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus can be used to perform tasks without explicit instructions.

Model: A trained function, e.g BERT, LLaMA, GPT2, think of it as .safetensors, .pt, or .bin.
List of LLM: GPT-1(OpenAI), BERT, T5, GPT-2(OpenAI), GPT-3(OpenAI), GPT-4(OpenAI) Claude(Anthrophic), Gopher, OPT(Meta), YaLM(Yandex), AlexaTM(Amazon), LLaMA(Meta), Llama 2(Meta)
Claude 2(Anthrophic), Mistral(Mistral AI), Grok 1(xAI), Gemini 1.0(Google Deep Mind), Llama 3.1, Llama 4(Meta AI)

LLM: A specific kind of model trained on huge text corpora for language task.
LLM: is a type of Machine Learning model
LLM: A specific type of Machine Learning model trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human language.

GPT: A specific architecture/approach for building LLMs

Claude: Antrophic's conversational AI assistant(also an LLM based product)
LLaMA - Meta's family of open-source language models

The right question would be how to create an inteligent assistent based on Machine Learning.
Build a LLM ? LLM are built using GPT


Since there are a lot of LLMs from different vendors there should be a standard way of accessing/running models. Or there should be a platform that would run this models regardless of the vendor.

Cause an tool like VS code that wants to integrate with multiple models has to provide different implementation for each ll model isn't it  ?
