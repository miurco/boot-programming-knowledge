Gradle Philosophy
-----------------


It starts with the way JVM is running/executing a program i.e class or a jar file. Also think of the --classpath option.

Think of a world where you would only have the following tools
javac - for compiling the files
java - for execution of jvm programs


how would you compile multiple files ?
how would you group your files conceptually and why ?
by running few scenarios through your mind can you spot the pain points, what are they ?


Gradle is providing the concept of a Source Set that is used to
1. Group source files conceptually
     For example when developing a source of files used to test what you build is correct 
2. Build the final artifact i.e a jar file that could be executed by jvm
