what is it ?

How can you look at it
----------------------
	a) parser generator tool
	b) incremental parsing library

parsing what ? a specific format like xml,json,yml,toml or any other formats
the "subject" is a given programming language source code that needs to be parsed


it can build a concrete syntax tree for source file and efficiently update the syntax tree as the source file is changed


tree-sitter aims to be

General enough to parse any programming languages
Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of syntax errors
Dependency-free so that the runtime library(which is written in purre C11)


so, I should use it first from cli, isn't it ?


Language bindings
