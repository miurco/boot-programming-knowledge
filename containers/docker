Docker
---------


dockerd -> containerd -> runc

dockerd 
docker daemon, high level management service the handles the entire lifecycle of containers.
accepts commands from the Docker CLI(docker run, docker stop, etc).
uses contaird as an intermediary to manage container execution.

containerd
-------
manages container lifecycle(pulling, snapshots, execution)

runc
-------
the actual runtime that starts/stops the container process.
a low-level container runtime resposible for creating and running containers - complies to OCI.
run processes inside namespaces and cgroups, providing isolation.


Kubernetes, the runtime stack looks like
---------
kubelet -> high level component that manages node-level operations
Container Runtime Interface -> Middleware that allows Kubernetes to talk to different runtimes 
CRI-O/containerd -> manages container lifecycle and storage,
runc -> Low-level runtime that actually runs containers

Note: Kubernetes does not use directly dockerd anymore.


kubelet -> containerd(CRI plugin) -> runc

kubelet -> CRI-O -> runc
