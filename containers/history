                                                              containerd and CRI-O
                            CRI, standardized                 are CRI compliant container
                            Kubernetes API that               runtimes
                            defines how kubernetes
                            interacts with container
                            runtimes








Kubernetes is not Docker

Container 
Container Engine, Docker
Container Runtime
Standartization, Container Images, OCI
Orchestration, Kubernetes has to handle an array of container image formats
Orchestration, Kubernetes does not use docker 
Kubernetes don't rely anymore on Docker runtime, it creates its own, CRI-O
CRI-O turns Kubernetes into a CONTAINER ENGINE that support runc and Kata Containers as container runtimes for Kubernetes pods


Containers require a container engine
Container engine - general software platform that supports container use.
Docker, CRI-O, RKT and LDX.


The CONTAINER ENGINE takes the user input, interacts with a container orchestrator, loads the container image file(from a repository)
and prepare storage to run the container. Finally, it calls and hands off the container to a CONTAINER RUNTIME to start and manage 
the container's deployment.


CONTAINER RUNTIME - a low level component of a CONTAINER ENGINE that mounts the container and works with the OS kernel to start and support the 
containerization process. For an OS such as Linux, the runtime would set up cgroups, set SELinux policy, set AppArmor rules and so on.
The most common runtime is runC, but other runtime containers include crun, railcar and Kata Containers.


Standartization is important. Several Container Images formats, the OCI has emerged as a popular and accepted standard for container images and runtimes
OCI uses runC.


Your runtime should be OCI compatible, Kubernetes can deal only with OCI compatible container runtimes

Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface(CRI) provides an API that connects Kubernetes to container runtime.
