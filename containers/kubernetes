Kubernetes


Control Plane Processes(The Brain)
----------------------------

kube-apiserver - REST API server. Everything goes through this. It's the only component that talks to etcd.
etcd - A distributed key-value database. This holds the entire cluster state.
kube-scheduler - 
kube-controller-manager - Runs control loops(Deployment controller, ReplicaSet controller, etc.) Each controller watches etcd via API server and takes action when actual state differ from desired state


Node Processes(The Workers)
----------------------------
kubelet - The agent that runs on each node. It watches the API server for PODS assigned to its NODE, tells the container runtime to start/stop containers, and reports status back.
kube-proxy - Maintains iptables/ipvs rules for Service networking. When you create a Service, kube-proxy configures the kernel networking to route the traffic.
Container-runtime - The actual thing running containers(containerd, CRI-O). Kubelet talks to it via CRI (Container Runtime Interface)


How to run kubernetes locally ?
-----------------------------

As you have only one node(your machine ...) you need a way to create virtual nodes.
Docker is quite good for this.


minikube start --driver=podman 
minikube start --driver=docker
minikube start --driver=hyperkit 
minikube start --driver=qemu 
minikube start --driver=none, Runs Kubernetes directly on your host-no containers or VMs. 


kind: Always needs Docker/Podman
minikube: Can use Docker, VMs, Podman, or bare-metal.


Production/Cloud
---------------------
EKS, GKE, AKS
OpenShift: Enterprise Kubernetes platform by Red Hat
Rancher: Multi-cluster Kubernetes management
