Podman is a container management tool that's an alternative to Docker, not to Kubernetes.

Key differences from Docker
	Daemonless, No background daemon process (unlike docker daemon) 
	Rootless, Can run containers without root privileges
	Docker-compatible CLI, Commands are nearly identical (podman run vs docker run)
	Pod support, Can run groups of containers as pods (like Kubernetes)


Dockerfiles are NOT Docker-Specific
	Dockerfile syntax is actually standardized and used by multiple container tools.
	Pod man uses Dockerfiles exactly the same way


Why this works ?
OCI Standards, it standardized the container image formats and build specifications
	Buildah Integration, used to build the image which implement the same Dockerfile Spec
	Industry Standard, Dockerfile are the de facto standard format, not proprietary to Docker
